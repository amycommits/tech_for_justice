         UNITED STATES OF AMERICA    :Criminal Number: 10-12345
                                     :Closed Case

          Joseph Public              
                                     
                                     
                                     
                MOTION TO SEAL PUBLICLY AVAILABLE RECORDS IN MULTIPLE CASES
                Pursuant to code ยง 16-803, Joseph Public (Public) respectfully moves this Honorable Court for an order to seal all publicly available records for each of the arrests and related court proceedings listed below. 
                D.C. Code ยง 16-803(f) requires the movant to seal all eligible arrests and convictions in the same proceeding.
                   In support of this motion, movant states the following:
                   
              CASE 1:
                 Public was arrested on June 9, 2009 for Driving Under the Influence. The Public was charged with Driving Under the Influence
                See Metropolitan Police Department Criminal History Record (Form PD-70) for  PDID No. 34890 attached hereto as Exhibit A. This case 
                resulted in a conviction on  May 5, 2010.
                
                4. Public was arrested, charged and/or convicted of Driving Under the Influence: an offense that is not an eligible misdemeanor and movant is filing this motion more than five (5) years 
                after the prosecution terminated. The burden of proof is on Public to show by a preponderance of the evidence that it is in the interest of justice to grant relief. 
                an offense that is not an eligible misdemeanor and did not result in a conviction and Public is filing this motion more than five (5) years after the prosecution terminated. 
                The burden of proof is on the movant to show by a prepnderance of the evidence that it is in the interest of justice to grant relief.
                
                5. When making such a determination the Court shall consider the interests of the 
                movant, the community's interest in keeping access to the records and the community's interest 
                in sealing the records to increase the movant's chances ofrehabilitation and employability. 
                The Court may also consider facts surrounding the arrest and any other relevant information provided 
                by the movant to support the claim that the relief sought is in the interests of justice or by the prosecution. 
                
                6. It is in the best interest of Public to have  records sealed because he is now working as data entry clerk for We Staff.
                We Staff recently acquired a government contract. Public will be required to obtain a security clearanc. to keep his job.
                Criminal records unsealed will affect his employment.
                
                7. While Public recognizes the interest of society in retaining access to these 
                records, Public believes that in this case such access serves little purpose. 
                Public's arrest and conviction are either not relevant or hold little interest for the public, 
                including potential employers, because Public is employed as a data entry clerk; driving a vehicle is not  required
                for performing his job. Also Public has been innvolved in AA since June of 2010 and has been sober since then.
                
                8. The community also has an interest in having this arrest and conviction removed from the Public's permanent record because 
                because since 2010 Public has been supporting his two children by his ex-wife Portia DeMoney. With the new contract that We Staff
                has acquired Public will get a raise in salary, better abling him to support his children.
                
                9. Public also requests that his record be sealed because he has demonstrated a desire to move past this incident through subsequent actions. 
                For instance, Public's supervisor, David Manager will verify that Public is a reliable, professional employee. James S. Sober that
                Public has been involved in AA since 2010 and has served the organization well. Rev. Ino Thegoodbook will verify that Public 
                has been a faithful member of the Second Baptist Church of Brrokland. Public has been free of arrests and convictions since the arrest in this motion.
                
                For the reasons set forth above and in the accompanying Memorandum, Public 
                requests that the Court order all publicly available records of movant's arrests, convictions, 
                and related court proceedings be sealed. See ยง 16-803. 
                
                WHEREFORE, for these and such other reasons as may appear to the Court, Public 
                respectfully requests that the motion be granted. 
                                                                Respectfully submitted 
                                                                
                                                                _______________________
                                                                
                                                                _______________________
                                                                
                                                                Filing Pro Se
                                                                
                                                                123 My Street
                                                                Apt. CC

  end
